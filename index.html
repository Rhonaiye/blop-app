    <h1>INTRODUCTION TO CSS</h1>
    <h2>WHAT IS CSS?</h2>
      <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. <br>
        It is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. <br>
        CSS controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of web pages.</p> -->
    <h2>PURPOSE OF CSS</h2>
    <p>Allows for consistent styling across multiple pages.</p>
    <h2>IMPORTANCE OF CSS</h2>
    <p>Improves user experience with visually appealing web designs. <br>
        Enhances accessibility by making content easier to read and navigate. <br>
        Boosts website performance by reducing the amount of repeated styling code.</p>

        <p>How CSS Works: <br> <br>

            CSS works by selecting HTML elements  <br>  and applying styles to them.
            CSS can be applied in three ways: inline, internal, <br>  and external (to be covered later in the week). <br> <br>
            The Concept of Cascading:
            
            The term "cascading" refers to the way CSS rules are applied in order of priority.
            The browser determines which style rules apply based on specificity, importance, and source order. <br> <br>
            Benefits of Using CSS:
            
            Consistency: Ensures a consistent look across all web pages.
            Efficiency: Allows for reusability of styles, reducing duplication.
            Maintainability: Changes can be made in one place (CSS file) and affect the entire website.
